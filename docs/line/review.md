# Line build: tests to review and UAT how-tos

One section per step. For each: what the tests prove (plain English), known gaps, and how to
check it yourself. A step is done only after your UAT passes; until then it is "awaiting UAT".
Branch: `work/2026-09-23` in `~/Repositories/construct` (local only, not pushed).

## ca1: Construct enforces the Line architecture (merged, awaiting UAT)

Test file: `test/line-profile.test.mjs` (29 tests, all pass). Run it:

```bash
node --test test/line-profile.test.mjs
```

### What the tests prove
1. The six Line rules each have a one-sentence reason and a description of how they are checked.
2. Bad `line:` settings in architecture.yml give a plain-English usage error naming the bad field.
3. A complete small Line project (library + two features, plans, packages) passes with no findings.
4. One failing project per rule (LINE-BASE, LINE-OWNER, LINE-DIR, LINE-WRITER, LINE-SHARED, LINE-LAYOUT, six tests): only that rule fires, exactly at the planted lines, and every message is a full sentence.
5. LINE-BASE messages say what is wrong and what to do (missing base, two bases, wrong kind, base that does not exist).
6. spec.md, index files and test files inside a feature are not treated as feature items.
7. Severities and exceptions in architecture.yml change or silence a rule.
8. Construct's existing layer rules (pages, workflows, components) still run on Line items.
9. A run can be limited to some files or some rules.
10. Projects that keep code under `src/` are found without settings.
11. A project with no library or features folder gets one clear finding, not hundreds.
12. Import paths are resolved for relative, `@/`, `~/` and `src/` forms.
13. Every kind of import counts (type-only, re-export, dynamic import, require).
14. Page files are recognised (pages folders, app router `page.tsx`, `Name.page.tsx`).
15. Every way of reaching a file-writing function is caught, and nothing that only reads.
16. Each shared concern names the module that wins; the owning package and configured owners are allowed.
17. Without a profile the old default applies; `preset: line` or `--profile line` picks the Line rules; an unknown name is refused.
18. The CLI exits 0 when clean, 1 with findings, 2 on a bad profile name.

Added in review (bugs found and fixed while merging):

19. Importing another feature's folder itself (`../../orders`) is caught as a cross-feature import.
20. A base link with `..` cannot point outside the library.
21. `const { promises: { writeFile } } = require('fs')` is caught as a direct write.
22. Names like `toString` are not accepted as profile names.
23. `--profile` with no name is a usage error; JSON output larger than 64 KB arrives whole through a pipe (it used to be cut off).
24. The writer gate uses the Line rules on a `preset: line` project: a staged cross-feature import is refused and nothing is written. Before this, only `construct validate` used the Line rules; the writer, approval gate, MCP and Cockpit's validate still used the old rules.

### Known gaps
- Validating one file still reads the whole project first, then filters (slow on big repos).
- LINE-WRITER does not follow variable scopes, so a local function that happens to be named `writeFile` can be flagged.
- Construct's own repo is not a Line project, so `validate --profile line` on it reports 621 findings (mostly direct writes in Trace and tools). New work must not add to that count.
- Construct's full suite had about 67 failures before this step (being fixed in cm1).

### UAT (CLI; the Cockpit view of these errors comes with cu4/cu5)
1. In `~/Repositories/construct`, run the passing example:
   `node packages/cli/construct.mjs validate --profile line --dir packages/core/profiles/line/fixtures/passing`
   Expect: no findings, exit 0.
2. Run a failing example:
   `node packages/cli/construct.mjs validate --profile line --dir packages/core/profiles/line/fixtures/LINE-DIR`
   Expect: two LINE-DIR errors, each a plain-English sentence saying which feature imports which and to promote the item to the library.
3. Try any other folder under `fixtures/` (LINE-BASE, LINE-OWNER, ...) and read the messages: each should tell you what is wrong and how to fix it without other docs.
