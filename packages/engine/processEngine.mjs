// #287 — the driver: control semantics for a running process.
//
// The boundary against #291, stated once so it does not get blurred later:
// this file owns *when* a step runs, *whether* a pause or cancel takes
// effect, *when* the transaction commits, and *what gets recorded*. It does
// NOT own how a step actually executes — spawning, LLM routing, capturing a
// CLI's console output. That is the `executeStep` function a caller supplies,
// and it is the whole of #291's surface here.
//
// Two guarantees are structural rather than left to each executor's good
// behaviour, because the approval gate on #291 is a safety property:
//
//  1. **Every step runs inside its own transaction.** The engine creates a
//     `createTransaction(projectRoot)` and hands it to the executor; staged
//     writes land only when the step succeeds AND `commit()` passes
//     validation. So a step that fails, is cancelled, or produces a tree that
//     does not validate has written nothing, and there is nothing to roll
//     back. This is why cancel does not undo: at step granularity there is
//     nothing to undo, and at process granularity undoing work the user
//     watched land would be a surprise, not a safety feature (the decision
//     recorded on #287).
//  2. **Every finished step records whether a model was involved.**
//     `completeStep`/`failStep` refuse a missing `llm` field, so an executor
//     cannot quietly omit it.
//
// Concurrency (the third decision on #287): processes do NOT queue behind
// `ui/server/src/commandRunner.mjs`. That queue exists because `runCapturing`
// patches `console.*` process-globally, which is real, but it serialises
// *command executions* — and a plan is minutes of them. Putting processes on
// it would wedge every interactive Cockpit command behind a running plan, and
// a Pause request would queue behind the very step it is trying to stop.
// Instead the engine has its own slot queue, `maxConcurrent` (default 1:
// parallel writers in one tree collide, which is why this repo's own agents
// use worktrees). The console-global constraint stays where it belongs —
// whichever executor #291 supplies still routes its in-process cli.mjs calls
// through `runCapturing`. Core imports nothing from `ui/`.
