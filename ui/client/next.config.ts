// ui/server (Express + ws) stays a fully separate process, called from this
// Next.js app exactly like it was called from the Vite app before (see the
// decision recorded on epic #64: Next.js API routes don't handle long-lived
// WebSocket connections well, so the wizard's transport stays on Express).
//
// Decision (documented on #70): rather than a Next.js rewrite proxy for
// `/api/*` (which reliably forwards plain HTTP but not a WebSocket upgrade
// without a custom server — reintroducing exactly the coupling #64 decided
// to avoid), every request — REST and the wizard's WebSocket alike — goes
// straight to ui/server's own origin (see lib/apiBase.ts), which already
// runs with `cors()` enabled for every origin. One mechanism for both kinds
// of call, instead of a proxy for one and a direct connection for the
// other. No rewrite/proxy config is needed here as a result.
// #454: threadmark-react (the dev-only design-review overlay) must be impossible to reach in
// the hosted build, not merely unreachable at runtime. features/design-review's own loader
// already gates the dynamic import behind NEXT_PUBLIC_REVIEW_OVERLAY=1, but that alone is not
// enough -- confirmed against a real `next build`: webpack still creates a (never-requested)
// chunk for the import() call regardless of the surrounding runtime check, and Next's own
// react-loadable-manifest bookkeeping records the source-level "...Loader.ts -> threadmark-react"
// import specifier text no matter what it resolves to. So when the flag is not "1" at BUILD time,
// this swaps the whole loader module for a stub that contains no reference to threadmark-react at
// all (ReviewOverlayLoader.stub.ts) -- the real package is then never read, resolved or emitted
// into any output file (client or server), and the literal import specifier never exists in the
// compiled source for react-loadable-manifest to record either. The package-name alias below is
// belt-and-suspenders in case anything else ever imports it directly. Grepping `.next/` for
// "threadmark" after a default (flag-off) build now finds nothing served -- only the unrelated,
// never-shipped `.next/cache/.tsbuildinfo` TypeScript cache (records type-only imports; not
// served to a browser or included in `next start`).
